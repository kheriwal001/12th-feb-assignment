    "Ans> An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts \n",
    "     the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are used to indicate that an error \n",
    "     has occurred during the execution of the program, which can be caused by various reasons such \n",
    "     as an invalid user input, division by zero, trying to access a file that doesn't exist, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur when the \n",
    "     code written is not valid according to the rules of the Python syntax, whereas exceptions occur \n",
    "     when the code is syntactically correct, but an error occurs during its execution. Syntax errors \n",
    "     are caught by the Python interpreter during the compilation of the code and prevent the code from \n",
    "     being executed, whereas exceptions are raised at runtime and can be handled by the program to prevent \n",
